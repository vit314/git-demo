Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give

There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free
========================


to be or not to be


not to be or to be

the same question

one more time
